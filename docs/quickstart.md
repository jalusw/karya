# Quickstart

In order to run the project, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js
- Yarn
- Git

I would recommend using [Volta](https://volta.sh/) to install the Node.js and Yarn.

## Node.js

```bash
volta install node
volta install yarn
```

## Yarn

```bash
yarn install
```
